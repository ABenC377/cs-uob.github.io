# Human-centered approaches to language and technology

_Conor Houghton_

The researcher will explore the relationship between documentation and
revitalization for endangered languages; would it be possible to
automate the production of learning materials, flash cards, picture
books, guiding reading, from the parallel texts produced by scholar
engaged in documentation? This project would involve some
technological innovation, but would also involve engagement with
linguists, education, experts in human computer interaction and,
through the Foundation for Endangered Languages, a partner in this
proposal, with language communities.
