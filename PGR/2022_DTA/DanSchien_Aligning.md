# Aligning Sustainability of Teaching and Research

_Daniel Schien_

Universities are increasing their ambitions to align teaching andresearch with the societal and political goals for greater
sustainability. This will require a significant transition that is not
yet well understood. This project will carry out an analysis of the
current research and teaching, with strategic emphasis on the Computer
Science and Engineering but with a broad view across disciplines, to
identify how well T&R is prepared for this transition, and how
University management, funders (UKRI and others) and other higher
education stakeholders can influence. The outcome can also provide
more specific recommendations to CS. Dr Dan Schien is an
internationally recognised expert in sustainable ICT. He is working
with companies such as Netflix, BBC and Spotify on sustainability of
ICT. He is also member of the Green Software Foundation.
