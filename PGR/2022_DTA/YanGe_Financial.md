# Financial technologies with machine learning

_Yan Ge_

Machine learning has been applied to many areas (e.g., biology,
medicine, physics) and achieved impressive performance. This project
aims to design, develop, and implement machine learning techniques and
apply such techniques to some financial tasks that are risk
management, fraud detection and asset pricing to perform the
quantitative analysis. This project will involve some aspects of deep
learning to design new algorithms based on graph theory to tackle
challenges in finance.
