# Software Privacy Reviews

_Inah Omoronyia_

This research will investigate the challenges of carrying out privacy
reviewsâ€”focusing on the privacy properties of software systems, their
validation and verification process. For example, appropriate checkpoints
during software coding to carry out privacy reviews are unknown. Arguably, such
checkpoints are necessary as privacy reviews that don't fit well with the
software development process will impact the quality of the system being
developed and create friction with business requirements. There are also
related challenges around sensitive data discovery in software artefacts to
trigger appropriate review. Expected outcomes include tools, frameworks, and
techniques to improve privacy reviews during software engineering.
