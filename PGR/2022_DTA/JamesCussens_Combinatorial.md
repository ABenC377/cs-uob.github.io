#Combinatorial Optimisation and Machine Learning

_James Cussens_

There is a growing interest in methods which combine solving
combinatorial optimisation (CO) problems and machine learning. In some
cases machine learning is used to learn the best strategies for
to solving an NP-hard problem. In other cases, CO methods (e.g. integer
linear programming (ILP)) are used to solve hard machine learning
problems. In yet another combination CO solvers have been included as
a layer in a deep learning architecture. The goal of this project is
to explore this area further to allow fruitful cross-fertilisation.
