# A unified postproduction workflow for low-light acquisition environments

_Pui Anantrasirichai_

Genres such as natural history place extreme demands on camera
technologies and postproduction due to their challenging acquisition
conditions. Distortions are particularly endemic in low-light video
due to the interactions between lens aperture, shutter angle and ISO
setting. This project explores perceptually inspired solutions to a
class of inverse problems associated with video production: denoising,
colorization and contrast enhancement, ensuring temporal consistency
in terms of colour, luminance and motion. Training strategies and
databases are needed that are cognisant of acquisition context,
capable of learning without explicit ground truth information. This
will need perceptually accurate objective quality metrics and loss
functions to validate our methods in the context of professional
content production and delivery workflows.
