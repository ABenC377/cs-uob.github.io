# Performance Portable science on the world's largest supercomputers

_Tom Deakin_

This project will look at how to get a scientific simulation
application running efficiently across the diverse range of
supercomputing processors. Supercomputers connect together many
thousands of processors in order to reach enormous levels of
performance. However, the landscape is diverse, with no one solution
leading. As such, the community has to be able to efficiency run their
applications across a range of advanced and highly parallel CPUs and
GPUs from many different vendors, including Intel, AMD, NVIDIA and
Fujistu/Arm, among others. Achieving a similar level of high
performance across different processors is known as Performance
Portability, but this is a significant challenge.

A PhD in this area will look at how to measure performance portability
and work with a range of partners in achieving performance portability
in different scientific domains. Avenues of research include how best
to write applications for a multi-accelerator nodes at scale, the
effectiveness of the latest parallel programming models towards
performance portability, how to optimise accelerator-to-accelerator
communication, how the performance bounds might change depending on
scale/architecture, etc.
