# Human computer interaction for conversations about being and consciousness

_Conor Houghton_ and _Aisling O'Kane_

We are interested in how technology can be used to explore "big" or
"difficult" questions. With this in mind we aim to develop a new
citizen natural philosopher approach to the science and philosophy of
consciousness. The amazing recent progress in neuroscience has relied
on reductive methods that are ill-suited to big existential questions
that interrogate subjective truths: we cannot define consciousness but
we are all certain we are conscious. In this project we will
investigate the personal experience of consciousness by collaborating
with the community to collect individual experiences of the mind. This
will develop a novel methodology using technologically enabled
interaction to empower people to value their own experience as
conscious beings and provide scientists and philosophers with insight
into these experiences.
