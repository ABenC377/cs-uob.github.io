# The Opportunities and Risks of Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education

_Paul Marshall_ and _Matthew Higgs_

This research will explore the opportunities and risks associated with the use
of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education. From [using AI-assisted
marking to reduce staff
workload](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2022/artificial-intelligence-offers-solution-to-heavy-marking-loads)
to [dealing with students using AI-assisted writing for
assignments](https://twitter.com/ted_underwood/status/1524583745197686784?).
The research will consider the needs and desires that drive the use of AI in
education; the resulting technical and ethical challenges; potential solutions;
and the long-term implications for teachers, students, and the future of
university education. The research sits at the intersections of AI + education
and research + teaching and provides opportunities to explore state-of-the-art
AI technology, integrate research into teaching, and develop a unique
specialism for a career in academia.
