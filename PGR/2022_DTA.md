# Doctoral Teaching Associate PhD Studentships Available in Computer Science

If you are interested in pursuing a PhD and have a passion for
teaching, please consider applying for a **Doctoral Teaching Associate**
(DTA) studentship/position in Computer Science here at Bristol
conducting PhD research for 50% of your time and teaching for 50% of
your time. The PhD can be focused in any area of computer science, and
we welcome candidates from across the discipline to apply. There will
be at least seven studentships available for 4.5 to 6 years, and
applicants should have no restrictions on how long they can stay in
the UK.

Please reach out to a potential CS academic supervisor ASAP to apply,
the application form will be closed when all posts are recruited. You
can get in touch with any academic you think might be interesting to
work with, but we have included a short list of projects below: for
these projects we have asked for unusual or adventurous projects that
might be of interest to the adventurous students we imagine might be
interested in this unusual opportunity; this is often in addition to
other more mainstream projects they might have in mind. There is some
more information about how to apply at the bottom.
