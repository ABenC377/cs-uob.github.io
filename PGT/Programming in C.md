# Programming in C

A crash-course in the C language. This old-school language will teach you things you’ll never need to know again (like dealing with memory 
leaks and using pointers), but which are massively important to understand. The course is like trying to drink from a fire hose -- a lot 
is coming at you all at once, and it’s hard to take in. But the results are hard to argue; writing a parser after 12 weeks with no prior 
experience is practically miraculous.
