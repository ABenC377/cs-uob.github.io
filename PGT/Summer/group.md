# Group Project

This type of project is suitable for students who want to go on to design and develop innovative products, or who may want to start their own 
companies in the future. The aim is to develop a demonstration of a project or service that has been produced in conjunction with, and tested by, 
potential users. The project may involve hardware design, software design, or both. The project may draw on ongoing research and technology 
development within the university or within an industrial sponsor. It may involve setting up a web-based service, designing a robot, or releasing 
some open-source software. In fact, anything with a technology base in computing and a potential for business or societal impact is a potential 
topic. This type of project provides an excellent opportunity for students to work with external companies and organisations and at the same time 
enables companies and organisations to work with the university and engage with its students.

You are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the group project option, and this will be the default option if you don’t have a specific 
individual project in mind. The aim of the unit is to give your teams the opportunity to undertake an advanced group project, typically involving 
a significant amount of software engineering and building upon the experience gained from Overview of Software Engineering. You are expected to 
undertake a substantial project, with the number of team members aligning with the project delivery requirements, with numbers typically between 
4-6 students. These can be chosen from a list of recommended projects or, in conjunction with the Unit Director, proposed by your team. Projects 
will typically involve the design, development and evaluation of a prototype system or application. Collaborative projects with organisations or 
individuals within or outside of the University are strongly encouraged, including industry, public sector bodies, research groups or similar. 
The product and plan that you put in place during Overview of Software Engineering will guide your summer progress, and you will present your 
work to both your collaborators and academic supervisor, as well as submitting a comprehensive report.

**Intended Learning Outcomes:** Every unit, including the project, has a set of ILOs which guide their content and act as a benchmark with respect 
to quality. In relation to MSc group projects, we expect you to:
1. apply project management techniques to plan and organise the development of a substantial software engineering project;
2. produce a system design which reflects the requirements of all system stakeholders;
3. successfully apply software engineering practices and processes in the development of system components;
4. evaluate the extent to which outcomes of the project conform to system specifications and fulfil the needs of stakeholders.

## Project Phases

From a student perspective, the unit (and project as a whole) is split into three phases of activity:
1. A specification phase (during TB1 and TB2, part-time), in which you first select a project topic and Supervisor(s)/Advisor(s), then construct 
a document which outlines the topic and specified work involved;
2. An execution phase (during the summer, full-time), in which you actually carry out the work specified; and 
3. An assessed phase, (during the summer examination period) in which you deliver a report, a presentation, and optionally (depending on the project 
type and topic) other deliverables so your work can be assessed.

### Phase 1: Specification

The specification process for group projects will take place during Overview of Software Engineering in TB2. During this unit, 
teams will select from the available industry-presented projects or develop their own idea, and pitch their team’s proposed solution to the given 
challenge. In order to present a strong pitch, you are expected to take a professional approach to the project, developing a clear project plan with 
milestones and deliverables, making use of appropriate tools for project management and version control, for example, and assigning roles and 
responsibilities to team members according to capabilities and expertise. Once your team has been selected by an industry partner to work with them 
on a project or been approved to work on a project of your own devising, your team will implement this project over the summer.  
Projects will be assigned a Project Advisor who will provide guidance on the direction of the project, especially that relating to academic standard, 
and teams are encouraged to co-opt academics with relevant expertise in technical advisory roles.

### Phase 2: Execution

The execution phase is carried out full time over the summer, typically June through August. You will thus have approximately 12 weeks of dedicated work 
to complete and hand in the whole project. That said, you can always start work earlier - for example, completing some background research or initial 
trials with your technologies of choice can help you prepare for the summer.
What you actually do during this phase will depend entirely on your project topic, so generic advice can only go so far. Bear in mind:
1. There is _no_ taught content
2. There is _no_ formative assessment

You should also read the common pitfalls in this document, most of which are based in this phase. The most important advice, though, is to have a plan 
formulated during the specification phase, which specific milestones you expect to receive at specific times (even if it changes)! Without one, you’re 
vulnerable to procrastination and are likely to end up rushing things at the end.  

**Progress reviews:** Regular progress reviews should be undertaken by the student team in collaboration with the Project Advisor.

### Phase 3: Assessment

All team members are expected to engage fully with the project according to their role and this element will form part of the assessment. 
The project assessment will be broken down as follows:
- 60% group report, providing details of the project motivation, design, implementation and evaluation.
- 10% final group presentation, showcasing and demonstrating the outcomes of the project, and involving contributions from all team members.
- 20% individual report, providing descriptions of and reflections on the student’s own contribution to the project and their personal view of the project, 
its outcomes and future work.
- 10% individual engagement assessment, based on a student’s contribution to regular team update presentations to the academic supervisor.
