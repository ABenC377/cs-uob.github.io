### Individual Project

This type of project is aimed at students who are interested in pursuing research in a university or in industry. The aim is to carry out an in-depth 
investigation into a specific area of computer science and to make a valuable and original scientific or technical contribution. The project will be 
done in collaboration either with a university research group, an industrial partner, or both. It may involve the design and evaluation of 
experimental hardware or software, or it may be a theoretical study. It may involve proving new results or fixing an expository gap in the literature - 
giving a detailed technical exposition of a difficult piece of theory previously split across multiple sources. Anything focused on developing an 
original scientific or technical contribution is a potential topic. This type of project provides an excellent opportunity for students to learn skills 
important in academic or industrial research.

This unit involves undertaking a major computer science project over the summer. It gives you the opportunity to make use of the knowledge and skills 
that you have developed during the taught component of the MSc programme. The expectation is that the project will involve a significant software 
development component applied to an application area, allowing you to demonstrate your ability to design, implement and evaluate a large piece of 
software that meets the specification and requirements of the application. You are encouraged to select application areas which align with your interests 
and/or previous degree subject and, where appropriate, to collaborate with organisations either inside the department (such as research groups), or 
outside of the department, either in other parts of the University, with industry partners, or with cultural/public organisations.

**Intended Learning Outcomes:** Every unit, including the project, has a set of ILOs which guide their content and act as a benchmark with respect to 
quality. In relation to MSc group projects, we expect you to:
1. Work independently or within a group on a Computer Science or related project for which they have defined the objectives and rationale.
2. Apply knowledge about an application area to a specific problem, which may be engineering, analytical, academic or applied in nature.
3. Design, implement and evaluate a solution to the chosen problem, including the use of suitable frameworks, methodologies and practices.
4. Effectively document your work and to communicate your design, implementation, evaluation and conclusions, including motivation, justification 
and analysis of the approach adopted.

## Project Phases

From a student perspective, the unit (and project as a whole) is split into three phases of activity:
1. A specification phase (during TB1 and TB2, part-time), in which you first select a project topic and Supervisor(s)/Advisor(s), then construct 
a document which outlines the topic and specified work involved;
2. An execution phase (during the summer, full-time), in which you actually carry out the work specified; and 
3. An assessed phase, (during the summer examination period) in which you deliver a report, a presentation, and optionally (depending on the project 
type and topic) other deliverables so your work can be assessed.
These three phases will vary significantly depending on the type of project (group or individual) you choose, and the topic of your project. 

### Phase 1: Specification

You should begin thinking about your project area within TB1 as part of the unit COMSM0084 Introduction to Computer Science, 
where you will be introduced to best practices in designing, implementing, evaluating and writing up computer science projects. You are encouraged to 
come up with your own project ideas, developing them during TB1 and TB2, with projects being confirmed within TB2, including potential project partners. 
You will also select an appropriate academic supervisor who will provide guidance and advice during the project. Please note that you are responsible 
for seeking and securing an academic supervisor. One will not be assigned to you. 

### Phase 2: Execution

The execution phase is carried out full time over the summer, typically June through August. You will thus have approximately 12 weeks of dedicated work 
to complete and hand in the whole project. That said, you can always start work earlier - for example, completing some background research or initial 
trials with your technologies of choice can help you prepare for the summer.
What you actually do during this phase will depend entirely on your project topic, so generic advice can only go so far. Bear in mind:
1. There is _no_ taught content
2. There is _no_ formative assessment

You should also read the common pitfalls in this document, most of which are based in this phase. The most important advice, though, is to have a plan 
formulated during the specification phase, which specific milestones you expect to receive at specific times (even if it changes)! Without one, youâ€™re 
vulnerable to procrastination and are likely to end up rushing things at the end.  

**Progress reviews:** Regular progress reviews should be undertaken by the student in collaboration with the Project Advisor.

### Phase 3: Assessment

Projects are assessed in August/September by a demonstration and viva relating to the work completed and by a report. In the case of 
a group project, students do a joint demonstration and viva and submit both a joint report and individual reports, with the latter covering individual 
contributions and evaluations of the project.
