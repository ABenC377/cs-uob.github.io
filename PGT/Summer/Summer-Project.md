# Project

## Introduction

- Unit Director: Peter Bennet
- Assessment: 100% coursework (Assessed slightly differently depending on whether you take the group or individual project option)
- Credit points: 60

### Principles and Design

The summer project is the culmination of your studies. This is your chance to demonstrate what you’ve learned and put your skills on display. 
It is designed to complement the goals of your taught units, exercising all of the professional, conceptual, and technical skills you have 
developed throughout the course. This, of course, implies challenges, but the result is always always something you, as a student, and we, 
as a Department, can be proud of. From an academic perspective several core principles act as a guide:

**Engagement in self-directed, independent work:** You (as a team, if you participate in the group project, or as an individual if you pursue 
an individual project) are responsible for every aspect of the project. Numerous sources of support and advice are clearly available, but you 
should take ultimate ownership of the project and therefore drive its organisation and delivery. This aspect can be both challenging and 
exciting. On one hand, you must cope with this responsibility. On the other, it allows a level of freedom that doesn’t exist elsewhere in 
the course. 

**In-depth investigation of topics with significant challenge:** Our expectation is that MSc projects will focus on a topic with some 
challenge: the topic will ideally capture a focused set of problems or objectives, whose difficulty and value are carefully identified and 
clearly articulated. Projects are typically distinguished by this requirement, the depth (and sometimes volume) of resulting work, and also by 
added emphasis on higher-level understanding and critical analysis. However, it remains important that the type of challenge can legitimately 
differ between project topics: this fact stems naturally from the vast diversity within Computer Science as a subject. Our goal is to recognise 
and support this diversity while still rewarding higher-quality work (of whatever type) with higher marks.

### Group Project

This type of project is suitable for students who want to go on to design and develop innovative products, or who may want to start their own 
companies in the future. The aim is to develop a demonstration of a project or service that has been produced in conjunction with, and tested by, 
potential users. The project may involve hardware design, software design, or both. The project may drowa on ongoing research and technology 
development within the university or within an industrial sponsor. It may involve setting up a web-based service, designing a robot, or releasing 
some open-source software. In fact, anything with a technology base in computing and a potential for business or societal impact is a potential 
topic. This type of project provides an excellent opportunity for students to work with external companies and organisations and at the same time 
enables companies and organisations to work with the university and engage with its students.

You are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the group project option, and this will be the default option if you don’t have a specific 
individual project in mind. The aim of the unit is to give your teams the opportunity to undertake an advanced group project, typically involving 
a significant amount of software engineering and building upon the experience gained from Overview of Software Engineering. You are expected to 
undertake a substantial project, with the number of team members aligning with the project delivery requirements, with numbers typically between 
4-6 students. These can be chosen from a list of recommended projects or, in conjunction with the Unit Director, proposed by your team. Projects 
will typically involve the design, development and evaluation of a prototype system or application. Collaborative projects with organisations or 
individuals within or outside of the University are strongly encouraged, including industry, public sector bodies, research groups or similar. 
The product and plan that you put in place during Overview of Software Engineering will guide your summer progress, and you will present your 
work to both your collaborators and academic supervisor, as well as submitting a comprehensive report.

**Intended Learning Outcomes:** Every unit, including the project, has a set of ILOs which guide their content and act as a benchmark with respect 
to quality. In relation to MSc group projects, we expect you to:
1. apply project management techniques to plan and organise the development of a substantial software engineering project;
2. produce a system design which reflects the requirements of all system stakeholders;
3. successfully apply software engineering practices and processes in the development of system components;
4. evaluate the extent to which outcomes of the project conform to system specifications and fulfil the needs of stakeholders.

### Individual Project

This type of project is aimed at students who are interested in pursuing research in a university or in industry. The aim is to carry out an in-depth 
investigation into a specific area of computer science and to make a valuable and original scientific or technical contribution. The project will be 
done in collaboration either with a university research group, an industrial partner, or both. It may involve the design and evaluation of 
experimental hardware or software, or it may be a theoretical study. It may involve proving new results or fixing an expository gap in the literature - 
giving a detailed technical exposition of a difficult piece of theory previously split across multiple sources. Anything focused on developing an 
original scientific or technical contribution is a potential topic. This type of project provides an excellent opportunity for students to learn skills 
important in academic or industrial research.

This unit involves undertaking a major computer science project over the summer. It gives you the opportunity to make use of the knowledge and skills 
that you have developed during the taught component of the MSc programme. The expectation is that the project will involve a significant software 
development component applied to an application area, allowing you to demonstrate your ability to design, implement and evaluate a large piece of 
software that meets the specification and requirements of the application. You are encouraged to select application areas which align with your interests 
and/or previous degree subject and, where appropriate, to collaborate with organisations either inside the department (such as research groups), or 
outside of the department, either in other parts of the University, with industry partners, or with cultural/public organisations.

**Intended Learning Outcomes:** Every unit, including the project, has a set of ILOs which guide their content and act as a benchmark with respect to 
quality. In relation to MSc group projects, we expect you to:
1. Work independently or within a group on a Computer Science or related project for which they have defined the objectives and rationale.
2. Apply knowledge about an application area to a specific problem, which may be engineering, analytical, academic or applied in nature.
3. Design, implement and evaluate a solution to the chosen problem, including the use of suitable frameworks, methodologies and practices.
4. Effectively document their work and to communicate their design, implementation, evaluation and conclusions, including motivation, justification 
and analysis of the approach adopted.

## Project Phases

From a student perspective, the unit (and project as a whole) is split into three phases of activity:
1. A specification phase (during TB1 and TB2, part-time), in which you first select a project topic and Supervisor(s)/Advisor(s), then construct 
a document which outlines the topic and specified work involved;
2. An execution phase (during the summer, full-time), in which you actually carry out the work specified; and 
3. An assessed phase, (during the summer examination period) in which you deliver a report, a presentation, and optionally (depending on the project 
type and topic) other deliverables so your work can be assessed.
These three phases will vary significantly depending on the type of project (group or individual) you choose, and the topic of your project. 

### Phase 1: Specification

**Group Project:** The specification process for group projects will take place during Overview of Software Engineering in TB2. During this unit, 
teams will select from the available industry-presented projects or develop their own idea, and pitch their team’s proposed solution to the given 
challenge. In order to present a strong pitch, you are expected to take a professional approach to the project, developing a clear project plan with 
milestones and deliverables, making use of appropriate tools for project management and version control, for example, and assigning roles and 
responsibilities to team members according to capabilities and expertise. Once your team has been selected by an industry partner to work with them 
on a project or been approved to work on a project of your own devising, your team will implement this project over the summer.  
Projects will be assigned a Project Advisor who will provide guidance on the direction of the project, especially that relating to academic standard, 
and teams are encouraged to co-opt academics with relevant expertise in technical advisory roles.

**Individual Project:** You should begin thinking about your project area within TB1 as part of the unit COMSM0084 Introduction to Computer Science, 
where you will be introduced to best practices in designing, implementing, evaluating and writing up computer science projects. You are encouraged to 
come up with your own project ideas, developing them during TB1 and TB2, with projects being confirmed within TB2, including potential project partners. 
You will also select an appropriate academic supervisor who will provide guidance and advice during the project. Please note that you are responsible 
for seeking and securing an academic supervisor. One will not be assigned to you. 

### Phase 2: Execution

The execution phase is carried out full time over the summer, typically June through August. You will thus have approximately 12 weeks of dedicated work 
to complete and hand in the whole project. That said, you can always start work earlier - for example, completing some background research or initial 
trials with your technologies of choice can help you prepare for the summer.
What you actually do during this phase will depend entirely on your project topic, so generic advice can only go so far. Bear in mind:
1. There is _no_ taught content
2. There is _no_ formative assessment

You should also read the common pitfalls in this document, most of which are based in this phase. The most important advice, though, is to have a plan 
formulated during the specification phase, which specific milestones you expect to receive at specific times (even if it changes)! Without one, you’re 
vulnerable to procrastination and are likely to end up rushing things at the end.  

**Progress reviews:** Regular progress reviews should be undertaken by the student team in collaboration with the Project Advisor.

#### Ethical Approval

Depending on the type of project and evaluation you are conducting, you may not need to make a full application to the Faculty Ethics Research 
Committee (FREC). All projects fall into one of three categories: projects which do not require ethical review at all, projects which can be reviewed 
by your supervisor, and projects which require full ethical review by the FREC. (This process has itself been reviewed by the FREC, as ethics application 
0028.)

**Projects not requiring ethical review**  
A project does not require ethical review only if it does not involve gathering data from human or animal participants, either directly or indirectly. 
This means, for example, the author cannot conduct surveys, they cannot ask other people to test software, and they cannot take pictures or video that 
contain people. Two examples of projects that would not require ethical review are as follows:
- Jean is doing a project in graph theory studying snarks. This will involve reviewing the literature and perhaps proving theoretical results or writing 
some code to generate snarks. The only experiments Jean will run involve testing and profiling her own code.
- Adam is doing a project in machine learning, and he is attempting to train a neural network to recognise different art styles and periods. In doing so, 
he will use a large data set of public domain images downloaded from the Internet, and perhaps one or two photos of his own pieces. 

**Projects covered by blanket ethics approval**   
This category covers projects which involve gathering data only from humans (not from animals) and only under the following circumstances:
- The project does not gather data from a vulnerable population, such as people affected by illness or economic disadvantage, children under 18 years of 
age, or people recruited from self-help groups. 
- The project does not gather data about: racial or ethnic origin, religious or similar beliefs, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health, 
sexual activities, criminal history, drug use, or other obviously sensitive information.
- All data is anonymous at collection, so that if the data were to be lost there would be no realistic prospect of the participants being identified. In 
particular, the project does not take photos, videos, or audio recordings of people, and it does not ask about names, addressed, postcodes, phone numbers, 
email addresses, physical features, or social media handles.
- Before any data is gathered from a participant, they give full informed consent. That is, they understand what data will be collected and what the data will 
be used for, and they give and explicit verbal or written statement to this effect. In particular, if part of the data comes from observation, then 
participants are told what will be recorded before they start.
- No participants are tricked or deceived in any way, for example by being given false feedback about their performance at a task or being misled about the 
focus of the study.
- If the participants are asked to perform a task, then this task involves no danger of physical or mental harm. For example, the project does not ask 
participants to sprint or to view distressing images.

Three examples of projects that would fall into this category are:
- Ayodya is writing a computer game for her project. As part of refining the core gameplay loop, she wants to get feedback from new players. She asks a few of 
her friends to play the game as she watches and takes notes. Afterwards, she asks them a few questions about the game. She is careful to tell them in advance 
that she’ll be observing them.
- Tan is writing a piece of software for research into grumkins for his project. Since Bristol researchers specialise mostly in writing snarks, he posts to a 
forum for grumkin researchers explaining his situation, asking what they would like out of a grumkin verifier and noting that any replies may be incorporated 
into his project. He then uses the requirements to decide what features to develop, and later releases the software as open source. When writing up his project, 
he removes all forum names from the feedback before including it. 
- Mohammed is testing the effectiveness of a new user-interface element as part of an HCI project. To do so, he codes two versions of a user interface, one 
using the new element and one using a more traditional design. He divides participants into two groups, one for each version. He tells each group he is 
interested in testing the effectiveness of the user interface of the software and asks them to carry out a task while he watches and takes notes.

If you think your project falls into this category, you should confirm this with your supervisor before you start gathering data. The two of you will then need 
to fill out a very short form available from the unit Blackboard page, and you will need to add a note to your report’s frontmatter.

**Projects requiring ethical review by the FREC**  
All other projects fall into this category. Four examples are:
- Chris is doing an HCI project to study effective survey design. They ask people to fill out one of two randomly chosen versions of an online survey about 
their favourite types of pizza. The two surveys are identical except that at the end, both versions ask for participants’ email addresses in different ways; 
Chris is interested in which survey design gets more people to give their email addresses. The email addresses are discarded on collection to avoid gathering 
personal data. This would still require a full ethics application, since they are deceiving participants about the purpose of the study.
- Alan is doing a cybersecurity project on the information inadvertently leaked via Bluetooth from peoples’ personal devices. He puts up a sign in the MVB atrium 
explaining that an experiment is happening, then sits there with a device gathering leaked data. He reads through it to remove anything potentially identifying, 
then includes it in his project. This would require a full ethics application, since it involves gathering data from participants who have not given full 
informed consent.
- Reut suffers from clinical depression, and for her project she is writing a mobile app to help fellow sufferers track their moods. When she has finished codding 
the app, she posts a link to Big White Wall (an anonymous support forum) asking for feedback. This would require a full ethics application, since it involves 
asking about mental health and gathering data from a vulnerable population.
- Johannes is doing a computer vision project in which he attempts to train a computer to recognise numbers on signs. As part of his test data, he walks through the 
department and takes photos of all the office doors. This would require a full ethics application, since it involves gathering information (namely, office numbers) 
from participants without their consent.

If your project is in this category, don’t panic! The next step is to make a formal Stage 1 ethics application to the FREC through the [OREMS tool]
(https://orems.bristol.ac.uk/ActivityForm/Index). The application process is not hard. It involves filling out a short online form. You should also attach a 
Participant Information Sheet (PIS) and consent form, at minimum. The committee may ask for you to include additional documents as necessary. Typically if a 
problem is “obviously harmless,” albeit not covered by the blanket ethics application, then it will be approved. That said, you must make your application well 
in advance, as delays of three weeks or more are relatively common, and you will not be granted an extension if this stops you from completing your project before 
the due date. If your application is approved, then you will need to add a sentence to your front matter quoting the application number. If the FREC identifies 
significant causes for concern, then they may ask you to make a Stage 2 ethics application. This is a more difficult affair, and if it happens then you should 
think carefully about whether your planned experiments are crucial to the project. 

### Phase 3: Assessment

**Group Project:** All team members are expected to engage fully with the project according to their role and this element will form part of the assessment. 
The project assessment will be broken down as follows:
- 60% group report, providing details of the project motivation, design, implementation and evaluation.
- 10% final group presentation, showcasing and demonstrating the outcomes of the project, and involving contributions from all team members.
- 20% individual report, providing descriptions of and reflections on the student’s own contribution to the project and their personal view of the project, 
its outcomes and future work.
- 10% individual engagement assessment, based on a student’s contribution to regular team update presentations to the academic supervisor.

**Individual Project:** Projects are assessed in August/September by a demonstration and viva relating to the work completed and by a report. In the case of 
a group project, students do a joint demonstration and viva and submit both a joint report and individual reports, with the latter covering individual 
contributions and evaluations of the project. (Do we have a percentage breakdown?)

## Marking

Each project is assessed by two Markers, one of whom is the project Supervisor. The Supervisor acts as a topic-specific expert who assesses the project on 
scientific rigour, and the second Marker may be a non-expert who provides an external perspective. In what follows, the Supervisor and the second Marker 
are together referred to as the marking panel. 
The overarching goals of the marking panel are to: 
1. follow the assessment process and criteria outlined below as transparently as possible; 
2. produce a robust mark for the project, suitable for use in ranking projects across the year and paying close attention to the classification boundaries; 
3. ensure the mark is fair and consistent when compared to other projects within the cohort; and 
4. minimise bias caused by over- or under-enthusiastic Supervisors and/or Markers. 

### The Assessment Process

Barring minor deviations (e.g., due to deadline extensions or mitigating circumstances), the intended assessment process is as follows: 
1. The Markers assigned to a given project inspect the associated deliverables closely, particularly the dissertation, and attend the relevant presentations. 
They each independently use the marking criteria detailed in Appendices A and B to arrive at an initial mark on the University’s 0–100 scale, supported by a 
written justification. 
2. The two Markers then exchange their marks and justifications and agree on a single consolidated mark. Differences in initial marks are to be expected and 
usually arise from a different weighting of factors contributing to the mark, rather than outright disagreement. Importantly, the markers do not simply average 
their two marks, but instead discuss the merits and failings of the project with respect to the marking criteria. If they are unable to agree on a mark, they 
may involve a third Marker. 
3. Once they have agreed a consolidated mark, the Markers produce written feedback for the student by merging and editing their original written assessments. 
They also produce a written explanation of how they arrived at the consolidated mark for the benefit of the Unit Director and the External Examiner (see below). 
The supervisor is responsible for finalising the agreed feedback. 
4. Once all marks are available, the Unit Director provides oversight of the marking process by checking all marks and feedback for consistency and, if 
necessary, proposing minor adjustments to specific Markers. 
5. As with all units within the Department, the unit marks and assessment process itself are then checked by the External Examiner, who will be a senior 
member of staff from another University. As part of the process of checking quality and fairness, they will inspect (a sample of) project deliverables; they 
may additionally viva (a sample of) students to check whether our assessment matches their own. 

### Plagiarism Checks

Checking for plagiarism is a difficult challenge, especially when a Marker is unfamiliar with the associated topic. A centralised, consistent approach is 
therefore applied to ensure as fair an outcome to the assessment process as possible: 
- The marking panel marks each project as normal, i.e., assuming there is no issue with plagiarism, but noting specific concerns as and when applicable.
- As early as possible after their electronic submission via Blackboard, the Unit Director uses the TurnItIn system to check all dissertations, then later 
collates any specific concerns identified by the Markers. 
- Any cases that warrant further investigation and/or penalty are then passed to and managed by a separate Departmental process. 

### Assessment Criteria

From both the student and staff perspectives, it is important to have a clear set of criteria to which the assessment process can refer. Such criteria 
are notoriously hard to construct: the diversity of project topics inevitably produces exceptions to any set of criteria, no matter how seemingly perfect. 
Our attempt at a set of criteria valid for most projects is given in Appendices A (for enterprise-type projects) and B (for research-type projects). For 
each mark range, we outline characteristics that we might expect projects in that range to exhibit.  
It is very important to note that most projects in a given mark range will not exhibit every characteristic we list – generally they will be better in some 
aspects and worse in others. The final mark should be based on the project as a whole, not on any single characteristic. That said, for a project to be 
awarded a given grade class, it should usually match the described characteristics in that range (or above) in most respects. For example, a project with 
roughly half its criteria in the 50–59 range, roughly half its criteria in the 60–69 range, and one or two in the 70–79 range should be awarded a 2.ii, not 
a 2.i or a 1st.   
As a general rule of thumb: 
- A project should get marks in the 80–100 range (i.e. a high First) if it is outstanding work. Most enterprise-type projects in this range should have 
produced a useful product likely to gain popularity outside the university; most research-type projects in this range should have produced either a novel 
piece of research suitable for academic publication or a piece of exposition that will be a useful reference even for established academics. We expect that 
in most years, a small proportion of projects earning Firsts will fall into this range. 
- A project should get marks in the 70–79 range (i.e. a First) if it is very good work. An enterprise-type project in this range should demonstrate that the 
student is a viable candidate for a good software development job, and a research-type project in this range should demonstrate that the student is a viable 
candidate for a good industrial research job or PhD position. We expect in most years, about 30-40% of projects will earn Firsts (in line with the BSc project 
unit).  
- A project should get marks in the 60–69 range (i.e. a 2.i) if it is good work but not exceptional. An enterprise-type project in this range should 
demonstrate that the student is capable of working in the industry, and a research-type project in this range should demonstrate that the student has a solid 
grasp of the subject. We expect that in most years, about 35-45% of projects will earn 2.is (again in line with the BSc project unit). 
- A project should get marks in the 50–59 range (i.e. a 2.ii) if it is mediocre work, or if it is good work marred by serious flaws (such as a major hole in 
a proof, a serious defect in an experimental procedure, or a piece of software that is not useful to its target audience due to a failure to gather stakeholder 
requirements). We expect that in most years, all but a small proportion of projects will earn a 2.ii or above. 
- A project should get marks in the 40–49 range (i.e. a 3rd) if it is poor work but has some redeeming features. Examples might include an otherwise-acceptable 
project which is of a length and scope more appropriate for a one- or two-week coursework project, or an overambitious enterprise project where the student had 
some promising ideas but failed to implement them in any meaningful way. 
- A project should get marks in the 0–39 range (i.e. a fail) if it contains little to nothing of value.

## Common Pitfalls

**Over- or under-ambition in project topic or execution plan:** An ideal project is typically a careful balance between less ambitious goals, which are clearly 
achievable, and more ambitious goals, which will be difficult to achieve and which therefore carry a greater risk of failure. Too few of the former 
(over-ambition) can lead to a project that fails to achieve its goals and doesn’t get anywhere. Too few of the latter (under-ambition) can lead to a project 
which succeeds at its goals but doesn’t contribute anything of value. In either case, the possible marks will be limited.

**Poor time management:** Time management is hard, and procrastination is tempting when the deadline is so far away. However, having a solid time plan in place 
and making slow, steady progress will go a long way to ensuring the success of your project as a whole. There is no substitute for being able to take the time 
to properly think through a problem rather than grabbing the first available solution, or for being able to go back and revise an assumption which has proved 
unproductive.Conversely, don’t work too hard! You can think of working late nights as borrowing from the future at a highly punitive interest rate - it might 
help initially but in the long run you’ll be a lot less productive than you would have if you’d worked at a slower and more even pace. Everyone is different, 
but as a general rule treating your dissertation like a full-time job (40 hours/week) can lead to a better project as well as ensuring you don’t completely 
exhaust yourself working odd or overly long hours.

**Failure to account for required time for writing:** One of the most common failure modes is not putting aside enough time to write your dissertation. Parts 
of this will often have to be left until close to the deadline, since they will be hard or impossible to write until you have done the associated work. On the 
other hand, if you leave all of it until close to the deadline, you will probably end up with a rushed mess that earns a low mark. Often, it makes sense to write 
incrementally throughout the project duration and to focus on writing up the work you’ve already done before expanding it further. If the cost of including an 
extra experiment in your dissertation is that your dissertation as a whole is poorly written, it will have cost you marks rather than gained you marks.

**Poor contingency planning:** Any serious project management includes some form of risk assessment, complete with contingency plans for likely issues. You don’t 
have to write this up formally, but you do have to think about it, or your entire project could come crashing down around you. Most obviously: use current 
anti-virus software and back up your work regularly, including an off-site backup in case of fire! (GitHub and Overleaf are your friends!) You will not be granted 
an extension due to data loss, and the penalties for late submission are severe. Less obvious risks, which still occur more often than you might expect, include:
- Inability to access vital equipment due to it breaking, not having permission, or the university not having it available;
- Prolonged inability to contact your supervisor(s) and/or advisor(s), e.g. due to a holiday or severe illness on their part;
- Finding out that a dataset that you were planning to use doesn’t exist or isn’t available anymore;
- Finding out two weeks before the project deadline that your code will need three weeks to run;
- Needing to perform behavioural testing for an enterprise project, but failing to find enough test subjects.
As an example, if the vital equipment from the first bullet point were a sensor required to capture data for later processing, a good first step would be to source 
both a main sensor and backup sensor early in the project, and possibly also to set up the processing step to accept synthetic data as an additional fallback.

**Lack of contact with supervisor(s) and/or advisor(s):** For topic-specific advice, your supervisor should be your first point of contact for the entire duration 
of the project. History suggests that regular meetings with your supervisor are a string indicator of a successful project. Such meetings do not have to be 
lengthy (a five-minute progress check in which you say “I am working on X but have not finished it” is fine), but without them you can easily find yourself 
spending weeks on something which is either a dead end or which will add very little value to your project. 

**Failure to write comprehensibly:** Over the course of writing the dissertation, you will inevitably become more and more familiar with the area you are working 
in, and the things you once considered difficult will seem simple. It is surprisingly easy to forget that you ever found them difficult, and to assume that they 
will be easy for a reader as well. This is emphatically not the case, especially if they don’t have a background in the topic already (which may well be the case 
with one of your markers). Avoid words like “obviously” and “clearly” in your dissertation - things may be neither obvious nor clear. Always try to remember that 
the person you’re writing for has not spent hundreds of hours researching the topic and will not know as much as you do. A useful technique to avoid this trap is 
to keep a working set of notes as you go (remembering your learning process can help you guide the reader through it as well).

**Overwriting instead of versioning:** More often than you’d think, a method you tried but decided against, or a section you wrote but discarded will be useful 
at some point in the future, perhaps in a different part of your project. If you never saved this method or section, however, you’ll have to do the whole thing 
from scratch again. Version control is your friend, for both your code and your report. Never assume that something you’ve written is useless. That useless code 
will come back to haunt you in a few weeks when it’s the perfect solution to another problem but you never saved it. 

# Academics

## What do you Need?

Gone are the days of using university computers for this degree. Although you could get away with not having a powerful computer in the past, it is becoming 
increasingly difficult to complete this degree using university resources alone. The online nature of a large portion of the course means you should have a 
reasonable laptop and high-speed internet access at a minimum. You will need to be on video chats for multiple hours a day, so solid internet access is 
essential. You will also likely find it more convenient to download most of the programs you’re required to use, rather than trying to use a remote desktop 
connection or work in the lab (as neither option is entirely reliable). 

Additional textbooks or materials are occasionally recommended by a unit director, but are rarely required. 

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism can be tricky to navigate as a coder, but it is a big deal and it is taken very seriously by the university. Plagiarism, according to Oxford 
University, is “presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own, with or without their consent, by incorporating it into your work without full 
acknowledgement. All published and unpublished material, whether in manuscript, printed or electronic form, is covered under this definition.” It doesn’t 
matter if the person knows you used their work or are ok with it. It doesn’t matter if you altered or adapted the other person’s ideas to make them your own. 
Any time you begin with someone else’s work, it must be acknowledged. In a paper or report, this should be formally, in the form of citations and a bibliography. 
In code, this may be done more informally, perhaps with a note in a comment. However, you must acknowledge the use of any other person’s work or ideas if you 
have used them.

Worth noting is that simply acknowledging that something is not your own work does not make it acceptable to turn in. If you have copied large chunks of code 
from someone else’s repository, it is unacceptable to submit that for a mark, even if you acknowledge whose work it is. It does not accurately represent your 
abilities or understanding of the subject material. 

The flip side of this coin is that we do encourage you to work together on most coursework. Although each submitted coursework should reflect the work ONLY of 
the student submitting it, discussing strategies, tools, methods, and the material is expected and encouraged. We also understand that part of the art of being 
a developer is understanding that you don’t always have to reinvent the wheel. There are a lot of excellent tutorials, forums, and even documentation out there 
that it would be impossible to code well without. We expect you to use these resources, and in fact it’s an important part of your education to learn how to do 
so well. However, these resources must be acknowledged, and they should be used as tools to help you solve a problem, not as complete solutions. (You are 
welcome to use screwdrivers to help you put up shelves, but you’re not allowed to hire a contractor to do it for you.) We recognize that this can be a fine line, 
but the following guidelines might help:
- Never exchange code with other students (via IM/email, USB stick, GIT, printouts, photos, ...)
- It's OK to seek help from online sources (e.g. Stack Overflow) but never cut and paste large chunks of code.
- If you ever do use code from an online source, CITE IT (even with a comment)
- If you don't understand what a line of code actually does, you shouldn't be submitting it !
- Don't submit anything you couldn't re-implement under exam conditions (with a good textbook) !

## IP 

From the university’s perspective, any intellectual property you produce while in this MSc program is your own. That is, all ideas and software you produce, 
even for your dissertation, are legally yours and the university has no claim to them. (There are potential exceptions to this if you are doing an industry 
project, as your industry partner may desire the rights to any IP you produce. This will be decided on a case by case basis between you and the industry partner 
in question.) That being said, any product you submit belongs to the university. That is, any submitted courseworks and the final report itself belong to the 
university and the university may use, post, or publish it as they choose. It is worth noting here that you will not submit the actual code for your final summer 
project to the university, so it will remain yours. Only the written report itself will be submitted and retained by the university.
