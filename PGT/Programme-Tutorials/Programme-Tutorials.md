### Programme Tutorials

These TA-run tutorials are designed to solidify and tie together the concepts you’re learning in your various assessed units as well as give you some preparation for interviews and the job market. The topics vary widely from week to week, and the unit is run in small tutorial-type groups so you have a chance to pick your TAs’ brains for the wisdom and insight they’ve picked up over the years.

These sessions run throughout the year until the Summer Project starts in May.
