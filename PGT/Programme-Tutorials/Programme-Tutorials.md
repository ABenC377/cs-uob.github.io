### Programme Tutorials

These TA-run tutorials are designed to solidify and tie together the concepts you’re learning in your various assessed units as well as 
give you some preparation for interviews and the job market. The topics vary widely from week to week, and the unit is run in small 
tutorial-type groups so you have a chance to pick your TAs’ brains for the wisdom and insight they’ve picked up 
over the years.
