# Programming in C

Often thought of as the hardest part of the course, this module launches you into programming in a fast-paced environment. It is normal to feel behind, especially at the beginning, but by the end you will have indespensible programming skills and knowledge to take with you into the rest of your career.

This unit aims to introduce you to the basic principles of software engineering. Successful completion of this unit will enable you to program competently and apply good software engineering techniques, implement a set of standard algorithms and appreciate the importance of space, time complexity of algorithms and the difficulties which arise in large-scale software production.

### Intended learning outcomes  
On successful completion of this unit you will be able to:

1. Programme competently and apply good software engineering techniques
2. Implement a set of standard algorithms
3. Appreciate the importance of space and time complexity of algorithms
4. Appreciate the difficulties which arise in large-scale software production.

### Teaching details
Teaching will be delivered through a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions, including lectures, practical activities supported by drop-in sessions, problem sheets and self-directed exercises.
