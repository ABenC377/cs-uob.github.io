# Programme

## Introduction

This MSc conversion programme is designed to turn you into a capable software developer in one year. 
The units and project are thus focused heavily on the skills you will need to succeed in a development environment: 
object oriented programming, team working skills, and project lifecycles. This is not a course intended to prepare you 
to deep dive into Artificial Intelligence or Data Mining by the end of it. You will be prepared to teach yourself those skills, 
should you choose, but that is not the focus of this course. This is aimed at students who have no, or very little, background in coding. 

It’s hard and gets harder, but in the end, you’ll have skills. Consider it an extended coding bootcamp. Bootcamps are hard.

## Units (TB1)

### Programming in C

A crash-course in the C language. This old-school language will teach you things you’ll never need to know again (like dealing with memory 
leaks and using pointers), but which are massively important to understand. The course is like trying to drink from a fire hose -- a lot 
is coming at you all at once, and it’s hard to take in. But the results are hard to argue; writing a parser after 12 weeks with no prior 
experience is practically miraculous.
