# Student Life

University is about so much more than just your course! It’s important to take care of yourself and maintain a healthy social life throughout your studies 
so you don’t burn out. If you haven’t already, you’ll soon learn that you can’t wait until “the next phase” to start living and enjoying life. You’ll always 
be working toward something, and always have the chance to overwork and neglect your personal life and wellness. Don’t make that mistake! Bristol is a wonderful 
city, and UoB offers many opportunities to take advantage of all it and the surrounding areas have to offer. 

## Health and Wellness

The university offers a myriad of wellbeing services, covering mental, emotional, and physical health. The Computer Science Society has put together an excellent 
[outline](https://cssbristol.co.uk/wellbeing/) of all the various types of support the university and school offer, or you can view the university’s official 
[Wellbeing Services](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/wellbeing/) page for mental health and wellbeing services, or the 
[Health and Safety](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/your-studies/study-2021/health-safety/) page for physical health information.

## Opportunites

The greatness of universities is that there’s always something going on, whether it’s volunteering opportunities, concerts, society adventures, or residence 
hall game nights. There are a myriad of places to track down events and adventures, depending on where your interests lie:
- The [Student Union](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/) is the home of everything student-related. They host all of the student societies, list volunteer 
opportunities, and are the official voice of the student body to the university.
- The [My Opportunities](https://engage.bristol.ac.uk/s/opportunities) page also hosts volunteer activities of every kind imaginable, so if you’re someone who 
likes to give back, you’re sure to find something here. It also has an [event listing](https://engage.bristol.ac.uk/s/opportunities/events/search) of various 
interesting things going on on campus (which sometimes overlap with SU activities and sometimes don’t. Best to check both if you’re looking for something to do!)
- If you already know what your “thing” is and just need to find some others who are also into it, there’s probably a “soc” for that! Check out the 
[student societies listings](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/groups) - UoB has everything from a kitesurfing society to a gospel choir to a chinese chess and 
calligraphy club. 
- Since you’re in CS, the most obvious group to join is CSS - the [Computer Science Society](https://cssbristol.co.uk/about/). They host hackathons, tech talks, 
and socials throughout the year, and are generally a group of great people. Worth a look!
