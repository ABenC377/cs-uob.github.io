# Extensions

### General guidance
- Evidence must be provided for all extension requests
- Extensions will only be granted where there are genuine reasons for non-submission by the due deadline, e.g. serious illness or personal mitigating circumstances.
- Extension requests cannot be considered after the deadline has passed.
- Further extensions are not permitted e.g. requesting further time in addition to an already granted extension

### How to Submit the Extension Request 
- The request should be submitted by [online form](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/request-coursework-deadline-extension-form) accompanied by your supporting medical/other evidence **at least 48 hours in advance of the deadline.** Extension requests submitted within 48 hours of the deadline are unlikely to be granted. 
- If the extension is granted, your due date will be updated by the school administration team and you will receive an email update to advise that this has been approved.

### When an Extension will be declined 
We expect you to plan your work, to ensure that minor unplanned events do not impact your submission.

- Most minor technical issues will not warrant an extension.
- Extensions will not normally be granted for a minor illness of short duration falling into the category of self-certification.
- Requests without accompanying evidence are unlikely to be granted.

### What happens when an extension is not granted
- If we are unable to permit an extension to your due date we will notify you by email

You should submit your work by the original due date or as soon as you can. Work submitted after the due date will receive a [late penalty](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-quality/assessment/regulations-and-code-of-practice-for-taught-programmes/penalties/) which reduces the mark for the assessment depending on how long after the due date it is handed in.
We understand that unforeseen circumstances can have a disruptive impact on your studies. Please discuss any concerns with your personal tutor and remember that the University has many support services on hand to support you if you are having difficulties- please see the [student support webpages](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/support/) for further information and links to support.
