# Plagiarism

Plagiarism can be tricky to navigate as a coder, but it is a big deal and it is taken very seriously by the university. Plagiarism, according to Oxford 
University, is “presenting someone else's work or ideas as your own, with or without their consent, by incorporating it into your work without full 
acknowledgement. All published and unpublished material, whether in manuscript, printed or electronic form, is covered under this definition.” It doesn’t 
matter if the person knows you used their work or are ok with it. It doesn’t matter if you altered or adapted the other person’s ideas to make them your own. 
Any time you begin with someone else’s work, it must be acknowledged. In a paper or report, this should be formally, in the form of citations and a bibliography. 
In code, this may be done more informally, perhaps with a note in a comment. However, you must acknowledge the use of any other person’s work or ideas if you 
have used them.

Worth noting is that simply acknowledging that something is not your own work does not make it acceptable to turn in. If you have copied large chunks of code 
from someone else’s repository, it is unacceptable to submit that for a mark, even if you acknowledge whose work it is. It does not accurately represent your 
abilities or understanding of the subject material. 

The flip side of this coin is that we do encourage you to work together on most coursework. Although each submitted coursework should reflect the work ONLY of 
the student submitting it, discussing strategies, tools, methods, and the material is expected and encouraged. We also understand that part of the art of being 
a developer is understanding that you don’t always have to reinvent the wheel. There are a lot of excellent tutorials, forums, and even documentation out there 
that it would be impossible to code well without. We expect you to use these resources, and in fact it’s an important part of your education to learn how to do 
so well. However, these resources must be acknowledged, and they should be used as tools to help you solve a problem, not as complete solutions. (You are 
welcome to use screwdrivers to help you put up shelves, but you’re not allowed to hire a contractor to do it for you.) We recognize that this can be a fine line, 
but the following guidelines might help:
- Never exchange code with other students (via IM/email, USB stick, GIT, printouts, photos, ...)
- It's OK to seek help from online sources (e.g. Stack Overflow) but never cut and paste large chunks of code.
- If you ever do use code from an online source, CITE IT (even with a comment)
- If you don't understand what a line of code actually does, you shouldn't be submitting it !
- Don't submit anything you couldn't re-implement under exam conditions (with a good textbook) !
