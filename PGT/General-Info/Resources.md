## Resources

**Facilities**   
University is the perfect time to take advantage of as much learning as possible. Not only on your course, but outside it. It’s unlikely you’ll ever have so 
many resources at your fingertips FOR FREE again, so take advantage of them! The Blackboard [Faculty of Engineering online Campus Bookings and Appointments 
Portal](https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/webapps/blackboard/content/listContentEditable.jsp?content_id=_5265660_1&course_id=_238502_1&mode=reset) is your best friend
when it comes to extracurricular learning. Through this portal you can book:
- Benches in labs, hack spaces, and shops for all your tinkering needs.
- Practical skills sessions for things like soldering, machining, prototyping, and more.
- Appointments with the tech hub, who can help you wrangle any hardware you might need for your project. 
- Tech talks - sessions with Hack space staff who can help you figure out what you might need or how best to tackle a problem.
As computer science students, you should have access to several pertinent buildings on the [Clifton Campus](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/virtual-tour/#s=pano26), 
including Queen’s Building, the Ada Lovelace building, the university libraries, and the Merchant Venturer’s Building (affectionately known as MVB) - our home 
base. Plenty of study space and lab options!

**Access**   
You should have your own computer that can handle the technical requirements for the course. That said, you’ll occasionally want to check your work on a 
specific compiler (for example) or have some other reason to want to access a university computer. You can access university computers remotely using 
[X2Go](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/fits-engineering-linux-x2go.aspx) or 
[ssh](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/fits-engineering-linux-ssh.aspx). Chinese students have a separate 
[VPN](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/vpn-china.aspx?CT=1603102434274&OR=OWA-NT&CID=924d1397-3a82-d0b6-d17c-0e4627d64a2c) for accessing 
university resources. 
 
**Technical Difficulties**  
If you have technical difficulties during the year, don’t panic! There’s help for that. If God forbid, something happens to your laptop, UoB offers a 
[laptop clinic](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/laptop-clinic.aspx) (they service mobiles as well!). For trouble accessing an ongoing 
lecture or other session, contact the IT help support line at 0117 374 2833. For any other IT-related issues (with Blackboard, Teams, MyBristol, etc.) submit an 
[IT ticket](https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/contacts.aspx).

**International Students**  
There are obviously a great deal of complications that come with being an international student. Not only do you have to do well on the course, there are also 
visa requirements to worry about, work restrictions, culture shock, the constant wondering about whether or not you’ll be able to stay in the UK after 
graduation, and potentially even language barriers. Fortunately, the university has plenty of resources to help you navigate everything.
- Fortunately for you, the UK government just opened up the [graduate visa scheme](https://www.gov.uk/graduate-visa): as a graduating student you can apply to 
remain in the country for an additional two years to job hunt and begin a job without requiring Tier 4 visa sponsorship from your employer.
- UoB [Student Visa Services](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/directory/visas/) can help you with all visa-related questions, including work requirements, 
maintaining academic eligibility, etc.
If English isn’t your first language, the [Centre for Academic Language and Development](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/academic-language/study/current-students/all/)
has lots of resources for helping you get your language skills in tip top shape so you can understand your courses and communicate in technical and academic 
English.

**Special Circumstances**  
The University of Bristol is devoted to accommodating and supporting students with disabilities. If you have disabilities of any variety, be sure to check out 
[Disabilities Services](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/disability-services/) to see what the university can offer you. Specifically, 
[alternative exam arrangements](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/disability-services/study-support/alternative-exam-arrangements/), 
[study services](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/disability-services/study-support/specialist-study-support-for-disabled-students/), help with 
[funding](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/disability-services/funding/), etc. are all detailed here. 
 
Everyone has unexpected circumstances - whether that be an illness, an emergency in the family, or a surprise pandemic - come up at some point. The university 
understands that and is happy to make reasonable accommodations. This 
[form](https://apps.powerapps.com/play/3172b943-0956-4b88-bf3d-3f37871d1170?tenantId=b2e47f30-cd7d-4a4e-a5da-b18cf1a4151b) is the official method to apply for 
extensions, log extenuating circumstances, and self-certify absences. 


## External Resources

As the saying goes, practice makes perfect. You’ll get some specific practice built into your program, but there’s always room for more. The internet is FULL 
of ways to practice and improve your coding skills, but here is a collection of some of the more obvious ones. Find what motivates you, and get coding!
- When it comes to interview practice there are two classics: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), an online repository of interview coding questions of every 
variety and at every level of difficulty; and [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) (a.k.a. The Green Book), an in-depth, 
step-by-step guide to coding interviews, complete with hundreds of practice problems (there are often PDF versions of this floating around if you ask your 
TAs/coursemates). 
- Hackathons are always a good way to improve your coding and potentially get noticed. Google’s [Kick Start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) 
competitions are for those just breaking into the hackathon scene to get a feel for things. 
- Open source projects are brilliant. You can help out someone else, make your mark on a project or product, and get experience, all in one go. Check out this 
[UpForGrabs](https://github.com/up-for-grabs/up-for-grabs.net) GitHub repo, specifically designed to host projects for beginners. Or, if you have a pet project 
you’d like to contribute to, keep an eye out for the “good first issue” label. If you really want to get into the spirit of things, consider 
[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) or [24PullRequests](https://24pullrequests.com/) - open source challenges in October and December, 
respectively.
- If you’re on Twitter, consider the [#100daysofcode challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), which encourages participants to code for at least an hour a 
day for 100 days straight. Hey, you’ll be coding a lot anyway, might as well!
- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/), and various others provide free coding tutorials to help you get up 
and going, or to teach you how to make that certain effect your website MUST have. It’s perfectly valid to use tutorials as a basis for your code so you don’t 
have to reinvent the wheel. (Just remember to cite!)
