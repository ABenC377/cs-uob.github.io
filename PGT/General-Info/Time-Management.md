# Time Management

This MSc will demand all of your time, and so it is not advised to accompany this course with a part time job or any volunteering.

### Study Time  
The university recommends that for every credit point, you spend 10 hours workng.
- A 20 credit point unit demands 200 hours of work
- There are 12 weeks in each teaching bloc, with week 12 for exams, and typically no new material in week 11
- This equates for 10 hours per week, per 10 credit points
- Each teaching bloc consists of 3 modules with a total of 60 credit points
- You are recommended to spend 60 hours a week studying, or rather 12 hours a day in a Monday - Friday working week
- This includes any time spent in lectures, labs or seminars.

Now **don't panic**, this is what is recommended, and most students will not keep up with such a high workload. It is certainly not required that you spend 12 hours a day working in order to acheive good results. However, this information should illustrate how important it is to focus the bulk of your time on your studies and refrain from taking too much time out for other activities.
