# Time Management

This MSc will demand all of your time, and so it is not advised to accompany this course with a part time job or any volunteering.

### Study Time  
The course has been designed so that you can overcome the problems presented to you within a typical work week. This would be around 40 hours a week, depending on ability and pre-existing experience in the field. Naturally, some students will work more than this with the goal of acheiving higher marks. With this in consideration, we recommend that you continually value your mental health throughout this course. Pushing yourself into late working days and high stress situations will make you unhealthy whilst also making you a worse programmer. Working 8am - 8pm every day will make you worse at programming than working 9am - 6pm. If you can work 9am - 6pm without a netflix break or a long walk/nap/ whatever your procrastination is, then you should have ample time to fulfill the requirements of this course.
