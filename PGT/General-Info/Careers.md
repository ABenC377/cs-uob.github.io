# Career Prep

## Bristol Careers Services

The MSc conversion program is a great course, and will teach you the basics of what you need to know to get hired, but you will also need to be self-motivated 
in order to be fully prepared. Coding interviews are tough, and take practice to be ready. They’re also a necessary hurdle if your looking for that well-paid 
developer job at Google or Amazon. [Careers Services](https://bristol.ac.uk/careers/) is your one-stop shop for everything career-related:
