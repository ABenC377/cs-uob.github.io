# FAQ

## General

Q: **Where do I get help on my homework?**  
A: Your first and best resource is each other. You have the course notes and recorded lectures and Q&A sessions to refer back to, which are all high-quality 
and provide good information. But if you’re still stuck, reach out to a coursemate. This sounds like a cop-out for the staff, but it’s genuinely a win-win for 
students to help each other. There’s a proverb that concludes, “If you want to master something, teach it.” If you can teach another student a concept that 
they’ve been struggling with, it will help you master it as well. If you’re the struggling student in the example, it doesn’t matter whether you get your help 
from a fellow student or a staff member. Plus, you may be able to return the favor later, on another topic. If the whole class is pretty stuck or if genuine 
clarification is needed, your next resource is the labs and the provided discussion forums. The lab time is set up specifically for students to interact with 
lecturers and TAs so you can get the help you need. Make sure you at least attempt your assignments before the scheduled labs or Q&A sessions so you know what 
your sticking points are and can ask the questions you have. It’s no use trying to do your assignment after the labs and then coming across 100 questions with 
no one to ask. The discussion boards are also curated by lecturers and TAs. If you have a question, first check to see if anyone has already asked it (odds are 
good they have). If not, post it yourself so everyone can see the answer. Please do not directly email or message lecturers or TAs about coursework or exam 
questions. They do not have the time to respond to individual student emails about the course. Personal circumstances are, of course, another matter. 

Q: **Can I take a holiday?**  
A: This course attempts to give you a solid understanding of the basics of computer science and software development in a single year. Accordingly, it is 
extremely full-on. Especially if you are coming from a non-technical background, you should expect to be working full time, with very few breaks. There are, 
of course, term-time breaks built into the year to ensure you don’t get burnt out. Use these to rest and take holidays, but try to avoid them during term time. 
If you miss classes or assignments, you will fall behind. The possible exception to this is the summer, during which you’ll be completing your final project. 
It is up to you, your supervisor(s) and advisor(s), and any group mates to determine if you think a holiday is feasible. If well-managed though, the summer 
does allow some space for a reasonable holiday.

Q: **What if I get ill or have an emergency and can’t complete my coursework?**  
A: The university understands that sometimes circumstances beyond your control impact your studies. The process begins with the extenuating circumstances 
form, which enables you to detail your circumstances and what kind of allowance you’re requesting (e.g. would you like an extension? Special consideration 
when the mark decision is made?) You can also self-certify absences and request coursework extensions from the same portal. If circumstances require additional 
consideration, you can contact your unit directors, the programme director (Andrew Calway), your tutor, the head tutor (Chris Priest), or anyone else you feel 
comfortable contacting and they can either help or direct you toward help.  

## Project-Specific

Q: **My supervisor/advisor isn’t responding. I haven’t spoken to them in over a week. What should I do?**  
A: The type and volume of interaction with the people filling these roles may differ, and vary over the project duration, but keep in mind that responsibility 
for the project is yours. Your Supervisor(s) or Advisor(s) should be treated as a source of advice and guidance, rather than a project manager. They aren’t 
expected to be available to you at all times, and will probably limit their interaction to weekly or perhaps fortnightly meetings. This helps them balance their 
workload, and gives you a change to achieve independent thinking and working. If you have a lot of general questions or are having trouble being decisive, 
document your questions and/or decisions and go over them at your next meeting. Don’t be afraid to choose your own direction! If you are genuinely stuck and your 
supervisor/advisor has been out of touch for several weeks, feel free to raise the issue to the project unit director. 

Q: **I have an academic in another department I’d like to work with. Can they be my supervisor?**  
A: You must have at least one academic supervisor based in the Computer Science Department. They provide a first point of contact throughout the project 
duration, offer technical advice (if and only if they are a topic-specific expert), and help to judge how your work aligns with various academic requirements. 
You may also have an external Advisor. They typically represent a collaborative contact (e.g. within a given company or another department), potentially defining 
requirements and providing topic-specific expertise or resources. If you would like to work with someone from a different department, or from industry, they may 
fill this role.

Q: **It kind of seems like group projects have it easier. I want to do an individual project, but I don’t want to be at a disadvantage. Will I have to work 
harder for a similar mark?**  
A: A group (as a whole) has no advantage over an individual project (or vice versa). For instance, the expectation is that a group with n members will produce 
n times as much output; working in this mode simply allows a larger challenge to be addressed via collaboration, with each group member assessed in a comparable 
way to the individual (even if the precise deliverables differ). 

Q: **I need to buy X for my project; will the department pay for it?**  
A: It depends. Your supervisor is your best point of contact, as, if your research aligns with theirs, they will likely be able to fund whatever you need out 
of their research budget. Your industry partners, if you have them, may also be able to provide necessary hardware or software access to support your project. 
As a last option, there is also a small SCEEM budget for small items that may prove useful in later years as well. You can email the [Tech Hub](engf-tech-hub@bristol.ac.uk) for more information. They may be able to help you navigate getting what you need. 

Q: **I have some specific IT needs, who should I contact?**  
A: Although your supervisor is typically your best first point of contact, the department has a dedicated Teaching Technologist who can help, namely Beth 
Cotterell (beth.cotterell@bristol.ac.uk). Part of her remit is to act as an intermediary between you and IT services - this provides you with a single point 
of contact specific to CS, while also providing IT services with a “big picture” view of shared problems or requirements.

Q: **Do you assess how well groups work for group projects?**  
A: An individual engagement assessment will be worth 10% of the final mark for all group projects. I don’t know exactly what this assessment will entail.

Q: **Should I include an Appendix for X in my report?**
A: The best way to think of an appendix is as content that could be of use, but is not crucial to understanding the dissertation. In line with most research 
conferences, the markers are not obliged to read appendices. As such, you should never move material to an appendix which you would like to be directly assessed.
A common question of this type regards source code. Since your source code should already be made available in electronic form as part of your auxiliary 
supporting material, including it all as an appendix is usually not a good idea. On the other hand, it can be sensible to include specific source code fragments, 
either as appendices or in the main body of your project, when discussing the details of your implementation. For example, if you were discussing a particular 
algorithm you developed in detail, it would make sense to include your implementation of the algorithm in question for easy reference (as you would a diagram).
