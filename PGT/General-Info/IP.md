# Intellectual Property 

From the universityâ€™s perspective, any intellectual property you produce while in this MSc program is your own. That is, all ideas and software you produce, 
even for your dissertation, are legally yours and the university has no claim to them. (There are potential exceptions to this if you are doing an industry 
project, as your industry partner may desire the rights to any IP you produce. This will be decided on a case by case basis between you and the industry partner 
in question.) That being said, any product you submit belongs to the university. That is, any submitted courseworks and the final report itself belong to the 
university and the university may use, post, or publish it as they choose. It is worth noting here that you will not submit the actual code for your final summer 
project to the university, so it will remain yours. Only the written report itself will be submitted and retained by the university.
