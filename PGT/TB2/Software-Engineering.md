# Overview of Software Engineering

The aim of this unit is to reinforce studentsâ€™ software development skills and build upon this foundation by introducing the principles of Software Engineering. The unit will introduce alternative software processes (such as Waterfall and Agile). Students will be introduced to a range of well-established software engineering activities, encompassing: systems analysis, specification, design, implementation, verification, validation and evaluation of complex socio-technical systems.

The unit also aims to highlight the importance of project management activities in the context of group and team development. These include activities such as planning, task identification, work allocation, scheduling and progress monitoring.

This unit will prepare students for undertaking a major development projects as individuals, as well as introducing effective mechanisms for collaboration in teams. As such, this unit provides an essential role in preparing students for their summer projects.

### Intended learning outcomes
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

- successfully analyse a specific problem domain;
- produce a suitable specification and design representing an appropriate software solution;
- effectively apply approaches to the verification and validation of software systems;
- successfully apply management techniques in the planning and monitoring of software projects.
