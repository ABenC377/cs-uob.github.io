# Object-Oriented Programming with Java

On successful completion of this unit students will be able to program in the Java language, have a good understanding of how good program design can help you, how to produce it and how to implement it in Java. The Syllabus includes:

- Object-Oriented Design: objects, classes, abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces, coupling, cohesion, code reuse, refactoring, design patterns, design methods, UML, testing.
- Programming in Java: characteristics of Java, comparison with other languages, syntax and semantics, how Java implements object-oriented design concepts, Java's APIs.
- Advanced Subjects: various advanced subjects in programming, and Java's handling of them, will be briefly introduced. Among others, these may include script programming, data structures from the Java libraries, Graphical User Interfaces, concurrent programming and networking.
