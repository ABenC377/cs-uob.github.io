Welcome to the website for the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bristol.

This page will provide links to the unit pages for all units in the department who have chosen to create a proper website, as well as the unit catalogue page that contains the official information on topics like credit points and assessments.

# Year 1

All these units are worth 20CP (credit points) each. The unit code numbering is not meant to make any sense, apart from the first digit being the year of study.
