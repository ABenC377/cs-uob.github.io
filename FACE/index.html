        <p>Welcome to FACE (Friday Afternoon Curriculum Explorer), an interface to help you pick optional units in the new CS curriculum launching in 2020. 
           The project is named so because I wrote most of it on a Friday afternoon.</p>
        <p>This page shows all units available to single honours Computer Science students. The units in year 1 and 2 are mandatory, later ones are optional (apart from projects).</p>
        <p><b>All data is correct at the time of writing to the best of my knowledge, but this is not the official unit catalogue and it may contain mistakes.</b> The data on this page was last updated on <b>11 February 2020</b>.</p>
        <p>Click on a unit to show its prerequisites as well as the units that it prepares you for. Further details may appear below the map of units. Click in some empty space to reset. Zoom in and out with the buttons at the top.</p>
        <p>Click this box to make it disappear.</p>
